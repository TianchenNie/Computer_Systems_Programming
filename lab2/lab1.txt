Q1. implementation_driver (and its sub functions)
Q2. g: 1 0.188
    gprof: 1.17 0.22
    gcov: 1.28 0.24
    O2: 1.57 0.295
    O3: 1.7 0.32
    Os: 1.54 0.29
Q3. O3 is slowest as it enables the heaviest optimizations.
Q4. -g is the fastest because it just tells gcc to dump debugging info on seg fault or such exceptions.
Q5. gprof is faster because it just adds instrumentation code that measures the time spent on function calls as well as generates a graph of function calls. However, gcov add instrumentation code that measures the frequency of every statement, and thus has larger overhead and therefore is slower.
Q6. g: 2.09
    gprof: 2.1 
    gcov: 3.21 
    O2: 1.14 
    O3: 1.14 
    Os: 1
Q7. Os is the smallest because the purpose of the -Os flag is to optimize the output binary size.
Q8. gcov is the largest because is needs to add a bunch of instrumentation code for measurements of each statement.
Q9. gprof is smaller because it just adds instrumentation code per function, while gcov adds instrumentation code per statement.
Q10. g: 1.19
     gprof: 1
     gcov: 1.06
     O2: 3.63
     O3: 3.64
     Os: 3.19
Q11. gprof is the slowest because it does not enable any optimizations and additionaly, runs instrumentation code.
Q12. O3 is the fastest because it has the most performance optimizations.
Q13. gprof is slower because it uses OS interrupts to calculate time measurements, and trapping into the kernel is slow.
Q14. -g:  
    45.36%  processRotateCWReference
    40.43%  copyFrame
    3.21%   get_counter
    -O2:
    38.78%  processRotateCWReference
    27.17%   copyFrame
    26.25%   get_counter
    -O3:
    51.16%   processRotateCCWReference
    36.66%   copyFrame
    2.64%   start_comp_counter
Q15. processRotateCCWReference is basically a wrapper function that is based on processRotateCWReference. Therefore, in -g and -O2, whenever it is called, the actual time is spend in processRotateCWReference, and therefore processRotateCWReference takes the most time. 
However, in -O3, processRotateCWReference is likely to be inlined, and thus processRotateCCWReference technically does not call processRotateCWReference anymore, and thus it takes most of the time in -O3.
Q16. -g: 40 instructions for processRotateCCWReference
     -O3: 204 instructions for processRotateCCWReference
     ratio: 0.196x
     This makes sense because for the -g version, processRotateCWReference is not inlined, therefore most of the time just need to branch to processRotateCWReference.
     However in -O3, processRotateCWReference is inlined, therefore it is expanded to a bunch more of instructions, not just a branch anymore.

    2. processMoveLeft called 68 times
    3. processMoveRight called 56 times
    4. processRotateCCW called 52 times
    5. processRotateCW, processMirrorX called 44 times
    6. processMoveUp called 32 times
